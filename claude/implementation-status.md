## 2026-09-08 - Claim flow visual redesign

- **Merge commit:** `e154cf1` (branch `claim-redesign`, deleted after merge)
- **Scope:** visual only, per the claim-flow redesign spec (Roman, chat,
  2026-09). Files: `src/app/claim-your-bar/page.tsx`,
  `src/app/claim-your-bar/verify/page.tsx`,
  `src/app/owner-dashboard/login/page.tsx`,
  `src/components/BarSearchTypeahead.tsx` (footer-row prop),
  `src/app/globals.css` (.claim-* card system). Claim logic
  (`src/app/api`, `src/lib`) byte-identical - verified at merge.
- **Delivered:** centered white card on every claim-flow screen; directory
  typeahead reused for Find-your-bar with add-your-bar footer row;
  selection flows into the claim step (claimed bars route to the
  reviewed-transfer wording); verify page leads with the bar name in the
  H1; solid black pill buttons; em-dash-free copy; 24h link-validity line
  on check-inbox (OTP expiry already 86400s); steps collapse to numbers
  under 480px.
- **Verified:** Vercel preview approved by Roman; post-deploy live smoke
  check (landing card, "black" typeahead + footer row, selection into
  claim step, 375px) passed 2026-09-08. Tests 209/209.

## 2026-09-10 - Carousel Bar duplicate merge
- Kwant method under standing approval: `carousel-bar-lounge` kept (richer:
  phone, hours, top10 tier) and reactivated; 2026 Spirited Best U.S. Hotel
  Bar nomination copied from `the-carousel-bar`, which is now inactive.
  Old live URL /bars/the-carousel-bar now 404s (no redirect infrastructure
  for bar slugs); flagged in case it shows up in GSC.
